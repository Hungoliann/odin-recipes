Introduction
The Odin Recipes project is a beginner-friendly HTML exercise designed to strengthen foundational web development skills. In this project, you will create a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page and individual recipe pages. While the focus is primarily on HTML structure, you’ll also gain experience with organizing content, linking pages, and setting up a GitHub repository. Later in your learning journey, you’ll revisit this project to enhance its design with CSS.
