        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>California rolls are a popular type of sushi that blends creamy, crisp, and savory flavors in a single bite. They feature a base of seasoned sushi rice wrapped around a filling of imitation crab, ripe avocado, and fresh cucumber. The roll is often sprinkled with sesame seeds or topped with masago (fish roe), adding a subtle crunch and a burst of umami. The vibrant combination of colors and textures makes it as visually appealing as it is delicious.

            What sets California rolls apart is their approachable, non-traditional style, appealing even to those new to sushi. The creamy avocado balances the crispness of cucumber, while the imitation crab lends a mild sweetness that pairs perfectly with the tangy sushi rice. Often served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, California rolls offer a balanced and refreshing taste that has made them a staple in sushi restaurants worldwide.

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sushi rice: Cook short-grain rice and season it with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the fillings: Thinly slice the cucumber and avocado into strips. Shred or slice the imitation crab meat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set up the rolling station: Place a bamboo sushi rolling mat on a flat surface and cover it with plastic wrap. Gather your prepared ingredients, nori, and a bowl of water to keep your hands wet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the nori: Lay a sheet of nori shiny side down on the bamboo mat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the rice: Wet your hands and evenly spread a layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a small border at one edge. Sprinkle sesame seeds or masago on the rice if desired.
            </li>
            <li>Flip the nori: Carefully flip the nori so the rice faces down.
            </li>
            <li>Add the fillings: Line the edge of the nori closest to you with a layer of imitation crab, cucumber, and avocado.
            </li>
            <li>Roll the sushi: Use the bamboo mat to tightly roll the nori and rice around the fillings, applying gentle but firm pressure to shape the roll.
            </li>
            <li>Slice the roll: Using a sharp knife dipped in water, slice the roll into bite-sized pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Serve: Arrange the pieces on a plate and serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.
