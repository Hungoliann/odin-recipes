        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Prime rib, often called a standing rib roast, is a classic centerpiece for celebratory meals and gatherings. This cut of beef, taken from the primal rib section, is prized for its rich marbling and robust flavor. When prepared, the meat is typically slow-roasted to ensure a tender, juicy interior and a beautifully browned crust. The outer layer is often seasoned generously with a mixture of salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs, creating a flavorful crust that complements the buttery, savory taste of the beef.

            Served medium-rare to medium, prime rib is known for its tender texture and succulent, melt-in-your-mouth quality. It is often accompanied by sides such as creamy horseradish sauce, au jus (a light beef gravy), and roasted vegetables. The combination of its luxurious flavor, hearty portion size, and visual appeal makes prime rib a beloved choice for holidays, special occasions, or any event that calls for an impressive and satisfying main course.

            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves (minced or powedered)</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs</li>
            <li>Olive oil or softened butter</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare the meat: Remove the prime rib from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1–2 hours to ensure even cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven: Set the oven to 450°F (232°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the roast: Rub the prime rib generously with olive oil or softened butter. Season it liberally with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, minced garlic, and fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place in the roasting pan: Position the prime rib bone-side down in a roasting pan with a rack. The bones act as a natural rack, but if your roast is boneless, use a metal rack to elevate it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear the roast: Roast the meat at 450°F (232°C) for 20–30 minutes to develop a flavorful crust.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lower the oven temperature: Reduce the heat to 325°F (163°C) and continue roasting. Use a meat thermometer to monitor the internal temperature: 120°F (49°C) for rare, 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare, or 140°F (60°C) for medium.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rest the roast: Remove the roast from the oven when it’s 5–10°F below your target temperature (as it will continue cooking while resting). Tent it loosely with foil and let it rest for 20–30 minutes to retain its juices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the au jus (optional): While the roast rests, deglaze the roasting pan with beef stock or red wine, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and season as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carve and serve: Slice the prime rib against the grain into thick slices. Serve with au jus and optional horseradish sauce for a complete experience.
